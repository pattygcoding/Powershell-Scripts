# Angular Start
Starts an Angular development server and automatically opens the application in Chrome browser.

### Dependencies
- **Angular CLI**: Must be installed (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)
- **Chrome**: Must be installed and accessible from PATH

### Parameters
- None.

### Example Usage
```
ng-start
```

## Cache Visual Studio Index
Creates and updates an index of .cs files in the current directory tree. Tracks changes in file locations and reports additions, deletions, and modifications.

### Dependencies
Must have write access to an index file in the directory you are executing

### Parameters
- `-Root`: Root directory to scan (default: current location)
- `-IndexFile`: Path to the index file (must be specified)

### Example Usage
```
cache-vsindex -Root "C:\MyProject" -IndexFile "index.txt"
```

## Clear Git
This script deletes all local branches that are not currently published. I like to use this branch because there is a Visual Studio bug that sometimes causes many past branches to locally respawn upon rebooting the app, causing unwanted clutter.

**NOTE:** You should not use this command if you don't regularly push your changes. I almost always push my commits immediately after creating them, so this is practical for me, but if you have unpublished branches with many commits, don't use this command until you publish them (or else you will lose your branch). Also, this command will not delete any branches you are currently checked out on.

### Dependencies
- **Git**: Must be in your PATH as an environment variable

### Parameters
- None.

### Example Usage
```
Clear-Git
```

## Compare Diff
Compares two files line by line and highlights the differences. It can also ignore timestamps if specified.

### Dependencies
Must have 2 named .txt files in the same directory you are executing in (see parameters)

### Parameters
- `-f1`: First file to compare (default: "TestFile1.txt").
- `-f2`: Second file to compare (default: "TestFile2.txt").
- `-notime`: Switch to ignore timestamps in the comparison.

### Example Usage
```
compare-diff -f1 "File1.txt" -f2 "File2.txt" -notime
```
## Connect Four
A fully functional Connect Four game, complete with color coded pieces and win checking.

### Parameters
- `-p1`: First player name (default: "Player 1").
- `-p2`: Second player name (default: "Player 2").

### Example Usage
```
connect-four -p1 "Bob" -p2 "Ryan"
```

## Compress Git
